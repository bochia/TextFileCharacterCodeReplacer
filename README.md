# TextFileCharacterCodeReplacer
Opens any text based file and replaces all occurrences of a character with its associated character code. Character vs Character code pairs are specified in a csv file.

## Installation:
Download the zip file and find the ReleasePackages folder. Underneath the ReleasePackages folder find the folder that represents your OS. In that folder there should be two files.
1.) The executable/app file.
2.) A csv file.

Copy these two files and move them to your desired location.

## Example of how to use:
Below is the example html file we will be using. We will replace the special characters in the list section.

Open up the csv file from the release package. It should look like this.
